The objective of our application is to automate and facilitate the student evaluation operation which is an essential practice in the teaching process. To make the operation of evaluating students and access to the data of this operation within the reach of teachers anywhere and anytime, we have opted for a mobile application.
The majority of mobile applications run on Smartphones which are characterized by their good autonomy and lightness, unlike PCs. These features make our application continuously available and accessible to teachers to carry out student assessment operations (continuous monitoring: presence/absence, participation, behavior, etc.). To expand the number of teachers using the student evaluation application, we have chosen the Android mobile system which is the most widely used OS in the world and which, unlike these competitors, is compatible with several smartphone manufacturers.
